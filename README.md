## 🎯 Overview

0L1 Labs is building **zero-knowledge proof verification infrastructure** optimized for action-specific verification at scale. We enable purpose-specific proofs that verify human participation without identity disclosure—creating trust without surveillance.

### Core Innovation

**Action-specific verification** powered by customized Semaphore Protocol circuits deployed on Base for low-cost, high-throughput proof validation with Ethereum ecosystem credibility.

**Key Differentiators:**
* ✅ Action-specific verification (not permanent identity)
* ✅ Software-native (no biometric requirements)
* ✅ API-first infrastructure (not consumer application)
* ✅ Decentralized verification network (Genesis Channel nodes)
* ✅ Multi-vertical platform (tokens, affiliates, wellness, credentials, AI compliance)

---

## 💰 Genesis Layer Infrastructure Nodes

**Genesis Layer badges represent ownership of one of 1,000 verification channels in the 0L1 network.**

### What You Own

When you purchase a Genesis badge, you own:

* **Genesis Channel** (#1-1000) - A registered verification endpoint in the network
* **Revenue Rights** - 70% of all verification fees processed through YOUR channel
* **Lifetime API Access** - Monitor your channel activity and earnings in real-time
* **Transferable Ownership** - Sell your channel on secondary NFT marketplaces anytime

**This is infrastructure ownership, not company equity.** Similar to:
* **Helium Network** - Own hotspot, earn from wireless coverage
* **Freename** - Own domain TLD, earn from registrations
* **Cell towers** - Own infrastructure, earn from carrier usage

### How It Works

**Step-by-step flow when an app needs verification:**

1. **App Integration** - Dating app integrates 0L1 verification API
2. **User Generates Proof** - User proves "I'm over 18" without revealing age
3. **Verification Request** - App submits proof to 0L1 network for verification
4. **Channel Routing** - Smart contract selects Genesis Channel using round-robin system
5. **Your Channel Selected** - Request routed to Genesis Channel #042 (yours)
6. **Cryptographic Verification** - Your channel verifies proof validity (~100ms)
7. **Fee Payment** - App pays $0.25, smart contract automatically distributes:
   * **$0.175 (70%)** → Your wallet ✅
   * **$0.075 (30%)** → 0L1 Labs protocol fee
8. **You Earn Passive Income** - Completely automated, no action required

**Round-robin ensures fairness:** All 1,000 channels take turns processing verifications. Over time, each channel processes approximately 1/1000th of all network traffic.

### Revenue Model

**Pay-Per-Verification Pricing:**
* Dating apps (age verification): $0.20-$0.30
* Financial apps (credit score check): $0.30-$0.40
* Healthcare apps (vaccination proof): $0.25-$0.35
* Gaming platforms (achievement verification): $0.15-$0.25
* **Average: $0.25 per verification**

**Your Earnings at Different Network Scales:**

| Network Monthly Volume | Platinum Earnings | Titanium Earnings | Obsidian Earnings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1M verifications** (Early Stage) | $175/mo | $262/mo | $350/mo |
| **10M verifications** (Growth Stage) | $1,750/mo | $2,625/mo | $3,500/mo |
| **100M verifications** (Mature Stage) | $17,500/mo | $26,250/mo | $35,000/mo |
| **500M verifications** (Scale Stage) | $87,500/mo | $131,250/mo | $175,000/mo |

*Earnings = (Network Volume / 1000 channels) × $0.25 avg fee × 70% your share × tier multiplier*

### Three Tiers

**Platinum - $500 (Channels #1-333)**
* Standard verification capacity
* 100 verifications/hour max throughput
* 1x routing weight (baseline share)
* Best value for early adopters

**Titanium - $750 (Channels #334-666)**
* Enhanced verification capacity
* 200 verifications/hour max throughput
* 1.5x routing weight (50% more traffic)
* Premium positioning

**Obsidian - $1,000 (Channels #667-1000)**
* Premium verification capacity
* 500 verifications/hour max throughput
* 2x routing weight (2x traffic vs Platinum)
* Maximum earning potential

**Why Tiers?** Higher capacity channels get routed more traffic at scale, enabling proportional earnings based on infrastructure investment.

### What Makes This Valuable

**Artificial Scarcity:**
* Only 1,000 Genesis Channels will ever exist
* No additional channels will be created at this tier
* As network grows, same 1,000 channels split all revenue
* Early infrastructure positioning in growing network

**Network Effects:**
* More apps integrate → More verifications
* More verifications → Higher badge holder earnings
* Higher earnings → Higher secondary market value
* Limited supply + growing demand = value appreciation

**Proven Business Model:**
* Similar to Helium hotspots earning $50-500/month
* Similar to Freename TLDs earning $100-10,000/month
* Similar to infrastructure nodes in any network (more usage = more revenue)

**Transferable Asset:**
* Sell on Blur, OpenSea, or any EVM-compatible NFT marketplace
* Liquid market for infrastructure ownership
* Exit anytime at market price

## 🚀 The Problem We're Solving

**Every "fair launch" in crypto has the same story:**
* Bots snipe 60-80% of supply in milliseconds
* Insiders get preferential access through back-channels
* Retail buyers get dumped on immediately
* Traditional solutions (KYC, whitelists, CAPTCHAs) don't work in Web3

**Beyond Crypto:**
* $17B affiliate market plagued by 30-40% bot fraud
* Digital verification requires invasive surveillance
* Privacy and trust are mutually exclusive

### Our Solution

**Zero-Knowledge proofs enable:**
* Prove you're human without revealing who you are
* Verify eligibility without exposing your wallet
* Fair AND private launches
* Trust without surveillance

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Built on Battle-Tested Cryptography

**Base:** [Semaphore Protocol](https://semaphore.pse.dev/)
* MIT Licensed, open source
* Audited by Trail of Bits, Veridise, PSE Security
* Production-tested by Worldcoin (millions of proofs verified)

**Our Customization:** TokenLaunchProof Circuit
* Simplified from ~150 to ~80 lines of Circom
* Optimized for single-action verification
* Removes Merkle tree membership requirement
* Focuses on uniqueness validation

**Deployment:** Base (Ethereum L2)
* Sub-second verification times
* ~$0.01-$0.50 gas fees (vs $20-100 on Ethereum mainnet)
* Ethereum ecosystem credibility and security
* Production-grade performance with institutional backing

### Genesis Channel Smart Contract

**Channel Registration:**
```solidity
struct GenesisChannel {
    uint16 channelId;              // 1-1000
    address owner;                  // NFT holder's wallet
    uint8 tier;                     // 1=Platinum, 2=Titanium, 3=Obsidian
    uint64 totalVerifications;      // Lifetime verification count
    uint256 totalEarned;            // Lifetime earnings in wei
    bool active;                    // Processing status
}
```

**Routing Algorithm:**
* Round-robin load balancing through all active channels
* Capacity-weighted routing (Titanium 1.5x, Obsidian 2x)
* Automatic failover if channel unavailable/maxed out
* Fair distribution guaranteed mathematically

**Fee Distribution:**
* 70% to channel owner (instant, automatic)
* 30% to 0L1 Labs protocol operations
* Real-time settlement to owner wallets
* Gas fees: ~$0.01-$0.50 per payment (Base L2)
* Non-custodial (you control your funds)

### How Verifications Work

```
1. User generates identity_secret (private, never shared)
2. Creates identity_commitment = hash(identity_secret)
3. Generates ZK proof for specific action
4. App submits proof to 0L1 API
5. Smart contract routes to Genesis Channel
6. Channel verifies proof cryptographically
7. Result returned to app
8. Fee distributed (70% to channel owner, 30% to protocol)
```

**Result:** One human = one proof = bot-proof by design

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

### What Genesis Layer Badges Are

Genesis Layer badges are **infrastructure node ownership licenses** providing:

* **Verification channel capacity** - Ownership of Genesis Channel (#1-1000)
* **Revenue rights** - 70% of verification fees processed through your channel
* **Lifetime API access** - Monitor and manage your channel activity
* **Platform input** - Advisory participation in development decisions (non-binding)

**This is property ownership, not company investment.**

### What Genesis Layer Badges Are NOT

* ❌ Securities or investment contracts
* ❌ Equity or ownership stakes in 0L1 Labs
* ❌ Promises of profit from others' efforts
* ❌ Guaranteed returns or financial performance
* ❌ Subject to SEC registration requirements

**Revenue comes from YOUR infrastructure's usage, not from 0L1 Labs profits.**

### Token Launch Disclosure

0L1 Labs is planning a **separate $0L1 token launch in Q1 2026** for platform governance and ecosystem development. 

Badge holders **may** receive consideration in token distribution design as founding community members, but this is:
* ✅ Discretionary (at 0L1 Labs' sole discretion)
* ✅ Not guaranteed or promised
* ✅ Not a contractual benefit of badge purchase
* ✅ Separate from badge value proposition

**Primary badge value: Infrastructure node ownership and verification fee revenue—NOT token allocation.**

### Risk Factors

* Technology development risks (delays, technical challenges)
* Market adoption risks (apps may not integrate as projected)
* Regulatory risks (compliance requirements may change)
* Competition risks (other verification solutions)
* Smart contract risks (despite audits, bugs may exist)
* Network usage risks (actual verifications may be lower than projected)
